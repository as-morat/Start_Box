# hello_world

Hey there, it's me, Ash!

## About

This project marks the start of my journey with Flutter, building a foundation in mobile app development.  
As my first project, "hello_world" is more than just an app — it's the initial step into crafting user interfaces, handling state, and exploring the flexibility of Flutter’s framework.

### Resources

For continued development and enhancement, here are some resources:

- [Flutter Getting Started Codelab](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/codelab)
- [Flutter Cookbook](https://docs.flutter.dev/cookbook)

Stay tuned for updates as I expand my Flutter knowledge and projects.
