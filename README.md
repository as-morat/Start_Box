# hello_world

Hey there, it's me, Ash!

## About

This project marks the start of my journey with Flutter,
building a foundation in mobile app development.
As my first project, "hello_world" is more than just an app
—it's the initial step into crafting user interfaces, handling state,
and exploring the flexibility of Flutter’s framework.

### Resources

For continued development and enhancement, here are some resources:

-- https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/codelab
-- https://docs.flutter.dev/cookbook

Stay tuned for updates as I expand my Flutter knowledge and projects.
